`npm run start`<br /> 

To run the unit tests:<br />
` npm test `<br />

To test the api Endpoint as stated on the bonus list on number 3:<br/>
` npm start `<br />
Then you just need to make a POST request localhost:3000/analyzeTasks (I have used postman) with the parameter inputString as the input for the string that is going to be treated.
