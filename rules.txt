//INPUT
//N = Number of users in the platform
2(N)
//The following N lines contain the ID and country code for each user.
1(Id user) PT(country code)
2(Id user) US(country code)
//The line after all the users and country codes indicates the number of tasks executed in the platform (T). 
3(T)

1(ID of task) 1(ID of user) 10(Time spent)
2(ID of task) 1(ID of user) 5(Time spent)
3(ID of task) 2(ID of user) 10(Time spent)
//END OF INPUT


//OUTPUT
1(ID of user) 7.50(Time spent by user)
2(ID of user) 10.00(Time spent by user)
PT(country code) 7.50(Time spent by country)
US(country code) 10.00(Time spent by country)
//END OF OUTPUT

//Important Considerations
The program should generate the following output:
The average time spent by users
The average time spent by country
Each output should be sorted ascending
Users and countries without any mention should be included in the output
The average output should be rounded to the second decimal place
